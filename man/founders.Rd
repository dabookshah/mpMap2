\title{Genetic data for founding lines

Return the genetic data matrix for the founding lines

If the \code{mpcross} object contains a single experiment a matrix is returned, with rows corresponding to founding lines and columns corresponding to markers. If an \code{mpcross} object contains multiple experiments a list of such matrices is returned, one for each experiment.}
